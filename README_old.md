### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zhi (pronounced as Z). After receiving a PhD in biostatistics from USC, I am currently working as a biostatistician at NanoString Technologies in Seattle. I don't know you found my account but here are some of my favorite repos. 

- :iphone: A Phone [Shiny app](https://github.com/zhiiiyang/OTworkout) to track your workout from GitHub. 

- :robot: A Twitter bot [mutsignatures](https://github.com/zhiiiyang/mutSignature_Pubmed_bot) using Python and AWS Lambda. 

- :bar_chart: #TidyTuesday Data Visualization [Gallery](https://github.com/zhiiiyang/tidytuesday). 

- ðŸ“¦ Two Bioconductor packages: [HiLDA](https://github.com/USCbiostats/HiLDA) and [selectKSigs](https://github.com/USCbiostats/selectKSigs).

- :speech_balloon: I am pretty active on Twitter ([@zhiiiyang](https://twitter.com/zhiiiyang)) or you can send me an email at zyang895@gmail.com.
